<p>The goal of VicmapR is to provide functions to easily access Victorian Government spatial data through their WFS (Web Feature Service). VicmapR leverages code and a lazy querying approach developed by <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02927" class="external-link">Teucher et al. (2021)</a> for the <a href="https://bcgov.github.io/bcdata/" class="external-link">{bcdata} R package</a>, which allows for a responsive and precise querying process.</p>

</h2>
<p><strong>From March 2023 (<code>VicmapR v0.2.0</code>) the way <code>VicmapR</code> obtains data has changed</strong></p>
<p>In March 2023 the data platform used by <code>VicmapR</code> will be migrated with the legacy platform discontinued. Changes have been to the <code>VicmapR</code> package to allow for the conversion and translation of of code in an effort to ensure legacy code still works. However, the migration may have unseen consequences and users are encouraged to review code.</p>

<span><span class="co">#&gt; 4  Contains mineral, petroleum, coal &amp; groundwater boreholes.  Minerals boreholes (and, to a lesser extent, petroleum wells) are actively maintained in the dataset.  The custodial role for groundwater and coal boreholes is in the private sector, and these parts of the dataset are not actively maintained.\n\nMineral, petroleum and coal boreholes are updated on an irregular basis:  Mineral borehole data are supplied by individual companies usually when their overlaying Exploration Licence expires; Coal borehole data have been updated from GHD Pty Ltd's (formerly GEO-ENG) data. Groundwater boreholes have not been updated since 1990 when the custodial role was given to Sinclair Knight Merz Pty Ltd (SKM) - refer to BORES100.\n\nThe origin of data varies considerably.  Prior to 1980 borehole data was recorded by the Geological Survey of Victoria (GSV) on 1 inch:1 mile plans and hard-copy borehole records.  This included data for water boreholes drilled by public and private sector, all boreholes drilled by GSV, petroleum wells, and some private-sector mineral exploration boreholes.  In areas where drilling was of particularly high density, locations were recorded on these plans as a single point or as occurring within an outlined area.\n\nThe parish was traditionally used as the primary classifier for numbering boreholes.  Some minor anomalies exist where a borehole and parish boundary may be on one side of a road or the other, or where parish boundaries have been moved.\n\nIn 1980 the location data was moved to 1:100,000 AMG plans.  In the mid-1980s a program of electronic capture commenced.  Borehole locations were digitised from the 1:100,000 plans with an accuracy of +/-300m.  For the areas of high borehole density where boreholes were plotted on a single point, often only the first ten and last ten were recorded in the database.  Boreholes whose parish was known but exact location was unknown were also recorded, but do not have a location.\n\nGroundwater boreholes:\nExtensive hydrological data was originally held by GSV, but these data are now held by SKM.  \n\nCoal boreholes:\nLocation and lithological data for coal boreholes has been provided by Geo-Eng and the old State Electricity Commission of Victoria.\n\nMineral exploration boreholes:\nThe capture of mineral exploration borehole data from open-file exploration reports commenced in 2001 and will progressively cover the state over a number of years.  The data are being captured at an whatever accuracy the source allows, typically between 20 and 250 m.  Assay data have been consistently captured.  Other downhole data, such as lithology, have not been consistently captured.\n\nTenement information for the small number of private-sector mineral exploration boreholes captured prior to 2001 was lost in the migration from the original VAX database to the current Ingres corporate database.\n\nHeavy mineral sand exploration: complete coverage up for data up to April 2002; updates planned for late 2003.\nOther mineral exploration:  coverage as follows - \n  St Arnaud, Charlton, Wedderburn 1:100 000 mapsheets - 31 March, 2001;\n  Dunolly, Rupanyup, Donald, Ararat, Grampians, Willaura 1:100 000 mapsheets -\t30 August 2001;\n  Warburton 1:250 000 mapsheet - 30 June 2002 (available mid-2003);\n  Ballarat, Creswick, Skipton, Beaufort 1:100 000 mapsheets - 30 June 2002 (available mid-2003);\n  Bendigo 1:250 000 - 31 October 2002 (available mid-2003)\n\n\nGroundwater data can be obtained at the following site \nhttp://www.dse.vic.gov.au/waterdata</span></span>

These structures segment the Goulburn River Valley into an upper, middle and lower Goulburn bedrock valley system suggesting that it is a broadening out upland groundwater system for most of its length.\n\nThe dataset was compiled by GHD to inform the report 'Potential Influences of Geological Structures on Groundwater Flow Systems' for DEPI's Secure Allocation Future Entitlements (SAFE) Project.</span></span>

This dataset plays a key role in the management of Victoria's Crown land. It is being created (June 2003 - Feb 2004) from migrating LCMP layers into the Vicmap structure.  At this stage it does not cover Metropolitan Melbourne.\n\nThe layer provides information about Crown Roads.\n\nThe dataset is continually maintained, obtaining maintenance from authoritative sources within State Government.\n\nGOV_ROAD_POLYGON is a polygon layer depicting Government Roads including roads as laid out on Parish Plans &amp; proclaimed as Road in Government Gazettes.\n\nThe Vicmap Parcel and VM_CROWN_SIMPLE layer is also recording "G" CROWN_STATUS Parcels that are Government Roads parcelled by the Crown Land Registry unit.</span></span>

This dataset consolidates a broad range of land resource information drawn from an uneven base to provide a consistent, if limited, coverage of the lands of Victoria.  The explicit links with the original sources of data have been retained.  The data set was developed from a range of studies of varying methologies and intensities over some forty years. \nThe reliability of the information varies across regions accordingly.</span></span>

These land systems sit within a geomorphological framework developed by Jenkin and Rowan.\n\nThis data set consolidates a broad range of land resource information drawn from an uneven base to provide a consistent, if limited, coverage of the lands of Victoria. The explicit links with the original sources of data have been retained.\n\nThe data set was developed from a range of studies of varying methodologies and intensities over some forty years. The reliability of the information varies across regions accordingly.\n\nThis edition (3) incorporates new survey material [Shires of West Wimmera, Lowan, West Towong and East Gippsland (east of Snowy River)] as well as changes in the nomenclature with the substitution of broad slope class with relative relief classes (eg. plains, hills, mountains).  An addition factor (lithological age) was also added to the key.  There is still a link with the Edition 2 version in the main Land Systems table.\n\nMore information on land system mapping can be found on Victorian Resources Online\nhttp://vro.depi.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/landform_systems\n\nDOI 10.4226/92/58e727e0dd1be</span></span>

The Ramsar Convention of Wetlands of International Importance, to which Australia is a signatory, requires contracting parties to designate wetlands of international significance within their territory for listing under the convention.\n\nThis layer is based on RAMSAR100 but has been realigned and updated to improve its accuracy. It has been updated to match current VICMAP parcel, road, hydro and water area data as well as using high-resolution digital aerial photography to improve its precision to 1:25 000.</span></span>

This dataset will assist staff in their management roles and facilitate promotion to the public.   All tracks are actively promoted to the public and maintained by the Department of Environment, Land, Water &amp; Planning. This dataset was initially created as part of the 2004 Recreation Facilities Database project and is now actively maintained through Vicmap Roads and extracted for use with apps and asset management tools.It is regularly updated to reflect changes to our recreationals tracks (including walking, mountain biking and other tracks).</span></span>

The harmonised map consists of 3,300 land units (totaling about 225,000 polygons) derived from around 100 soil and land surveys carried out in Victoria over the past 70 years. The land units have been attributed according to the Australian Soil Classification (Order and Suborder levels of the classification scheme) based on their likely dominant soil type. Particular attention was given to harmonising land units across survey boundaries. A reliability index has been assigned to each land unit based on the quality and relevance of the originating survey, providing a qualitative reliability measure to support interpretation and data use.\n\nSoil site data contained in the Victorian Soil Information System (VSIS), and information on the Victorian Resources Online (VRO) website and original study reports have been combined with landscape knowledge to develop the new maps. Data from approximately 10,000 existing sites recorded, mostly recorded in the VSIS have been used.\n\nThe soil type is based on land mapping conducted at different times, at variable scale, and for different purposes. Land units are therefore of variable scale and quality in relation to the soil they are representing. Many units will be comprised of multiple soil types and a range of soil properties, and local variability (e.g. at paddock scale level) can also sometimes be high. The mapping, therefore, is intended to represent the dominant, or most prevalent, broad soil type within the map unit. It is therefore adequate for regional or state-wide overviews but may not often be accurate enough for localised or within-farm assessments. For more detailed soil and land information, users are advised to refer to the original land study for any given map unit (e.g. via Victorian Resources Online website).</span></span>

Where a road segement has multiple names, TR_ROAD_REGISTER will have multiple overlappling road lines while TR_ROAD will have one road with multiple names.\n\nTR_ROAD_REGISTER facilitates road searching and efficent road name lablelling.\n\nIn addition the dataset has an atttribute MIN_CLASS_CODE which is the the minimum CLASS_CODE for all TR_ROAD road lines that have the unique cominbination of identifer vaules.  For example, if the road segments associated with the unique road identifer have CLASS_CODES of 0  (Freeway), 1 (Highway) and 2 (Arterial), the MIN_CLASS_CODE of that road will be 0 (Freeway).   This value faciliates feature filtering at different scales and symbolisation.</span></span>

Polygon attributes describe the public open space category and owner. The datset covers 31 municipalities in metropolitan Melbourne. \n\nThe definition used to attribute a polyon as public open space is 'those areas of public land and local council land that have an accepted and ongoing community use for outdoor recreation and informal activities, and that are freely accessible to the public'.\n\nThe VEAC Metropolitan Melbourne Open Space Inventory does not include Commonwealth land; schools; cemeteries; gated facilities; road plantations; closed roads; concourses around stadia; inaccessible Trust for Nature properties; 'services and utilities' public land that does not have an ongoing recreational use; future open space (e.g. areas covered by Public Aquisition Overlays); and uncategorised public land.\n\n1. 'Public Land' is Crown land and freehold land owned by Victorian Government Agencies.\n\n2. 'Local Council Land' is freehold land owned by local councils.</span></span>

The data includes VicTrack owned corridors and spurs into privately owned freight facilities. The data may also include any "under construction" corridors. The data does not include Tourist/Heritage Railways. \n\nThe data includes attributes which identify if the corridors are used by Metro (MTM) services, V/Line services, freight services and interstate services. The attributes also identify the presence of broad, standard and dual guage tracks in the corridor and the presence of electrification in the corridor.</span></span>

Vicmap Lite datasets are suited for use between scales of 1: 250,000 and 1 : 5 million.  The linework was sourced from Vicmap Transport. The level of attribute information, the number of features and the number of vertices has been simplified to suit the 1: 250,000  - 1 : 5 million scale range. The concept of a Scale Use Code has been introduced to help control the level of detail displayed.\n\nSearch:- roads, road, track, highway, transport.\n\nTHIS DATASET WAS LAST UPDATED IN DECEMBER 2015</span></span>

<p>As of VicmapR version <code>0.1.0</code> data is read in using a lazy evaluation method with the convenience of pipe operators (<code>%&gt;%</code>). A lot of the methods and code have already been written for a similar package (<a href="https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata" class="external-link">bcdata</a>) that downloads data from the British Columbia WFS catalogues. Using a similar approach, VicmapR allows users to construct a WFS query in a step-wise format. In doing so a query is reserved until <code><a href="reference/collect.html">collect()</a></code> is used on the <code>vicmap_promise</code>. The example below shows an extensive example of how the to easily read in spatial data:</p>

<p>VicmapR translates numerous geometric filter functions available in the Victorian Government’s WFS Geoserver supports numerous <a href="https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/tutorials/cql/cql_tutorial.html#geometric-filters" class="external-link">geometric filters</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>EQUALS</code><br>
</li>
<li>
<code>DISJOINT</code><br>
</li>
<li>
<code>INTERSECTS</code><br>
</li>
<li>
<code>TOUCHES</code><br>

<code>CROSSES</code><br>

<li>
<code>DWITHIN</code><br>
</li>
<li>
<code>BEYOND</code><br>
</li>
<li><code>BBOX</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These filters can be used within the <code><a href="reference/filter.html">filter()</a></code> function by providing them an object of class <code>sf/sfc/sfg/bbox</code> as shown above with the <code>melbourne</code> object.</p>

<p>Using <code>options(vicmap.base_url)</code> VicmapR can query data from other WFS services; while this remains somewhat untested it is relatively easy to point VicmapR to another WFS url. This option would need to be set every session to override the base VicmapR url. For instance, the BOM WFS can be used as follows:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="co"># set the new base url</span></span>

<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Using other Geoserver WFS urls will not necessarily work as expected due to the potential differences in the capabilities of the Geoserver instance</em></p>
