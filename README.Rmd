The goal of VicmapR is to provide functions to easily access Victorian Government spatial data through their WFS (Web Feature Service). VicmapR uses a lazy querying approach (developed from [bcdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata)), which allows for a responsive and precise querying process.

## Installation  

You can install the released version from CRAN with:  
``` r
install.packages("VicmapR")
```

Or you can install the the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:  
``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JustinCally/VicmapR")
```

### Dependencies  

Currently, the ability to use accurate geometric filters using `VicmapR` requires GDAL > 3.0. To see how to upgrade your version of GDAL and link it to the `sf` package visit: https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/#installing  

```{r dependencies}
library(sf)
sf::sf_extSoftVersion()
```


## Example

### Searching for data

```{r example}
library(VicmapR)

listLayers(pattern = "trees", ignore.case = T)
```

### Reading in data

As of VicmapR version `0.1.0` data is read in using a lazy evaluation method with the convenience of pipe operators (`%>%`). A lot of the methods and code have already been written for a similar package ([bcdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata)) that downloads data from the British Columbia WFS catalogues. Using a similar approach, VicmapR allows users to construct a WFS query in a step-wise format. In doing so a query is reserved until `collect()` is used on the `vicmap_promise`. The example below shows an extensive example of how the to easily read in spatial data:

```{r query_example}
# Read in an example shape to restrict our query to using geometric filtering
melbourne <- sf::st_read(system.file("shapes/melbourne.geojson", package="VicmapR"), quiet = T)

# Obtain a promise of what data will be returned for a given layer
vicmap_query(layer = "datavic:VMHYDRO_WATERCOURSE_DRAIN")

# Build a more specific query and collect the results
vicmap_query(layer = "datavic:VMHYDRO_WATERCOURSE_DRAIN") %>% # layer to query
  filter(HIERARCHY == "L") %>% # simple filter for a column
  filter(INTERSECTS(melbourne)) %>% # more advanced geometric filter
  select(HIERARCHY, PFI) %>% 
  collect()
```

VicmapR translates numerous geometric filter functions available in the Victorian Government's WFS Geoserver supports numerous [geometric filters](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/tutorials/cql/cql_tutorial.html#geometric-filters):  

+ `EQUALS`   
+ `DISJOINT`   
+ `INTERSECTS`   
+ `TOUCHES`   
+ `CROSSES`   
+ `WITHIN`   
+ `CONTAINS` 
+ `OVERLAPS`   
+ `DWITHIN`   
+ `BEYOND`  
+ `BBOX`  

These filters can be used within the `filter()` function by providing them an object of class `sf/sfc/sfg/bbox` as shown above with the `melbourne` object. 

### Using other WFS urls  

Using `options(vicmap.base_url)` VicmapR can query data from other WFS services; while this remains somewhat untested it is relatively easy to point VicmapR to another WFS url. This option would need to be set every session to override the base VicmapR url. For instance, the BOM WFS can be used as follows:  

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# set the new base url
options(vicmap.base_url = "http://geofabric.bom.gov.au/simplefeatures/ahgf_shcatch/wfs")

# collect a data sample
catchments <- vicmap_query("ahgf_shcatch:AHGFCatchment") %>% 
  head(10) %>% 
  collect()
```

*__Note__: Using other Geoserver WFS urls will not necessarily work as expected due to the potential differences in the capabilities of the Geoserver instance*
